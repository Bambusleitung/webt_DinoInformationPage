    <h1>Theories of their extinction</h1>
    <h2>Probable theories</h2>
        <h3>Meteor</h3>
            <p>
                The most well-known theory is the meteor theory. <br>
                In 1980 two scientists proposed the notion <br>
                a meteor the size of a mountain hit into Earth 66 million years ago.<br>
                <br>
                The key piece of evidence is an oddly high amount of the metal iridium in <br>
                the geologic boundary zone that seems to cap any known rock layers containing dinosaur fossils.<br>
                The theory gained even more steam when scientists were able to link the extinction event<br>
                to a huge crater along the coast of Mexico’s Yucatán Peninsula.<br>
            </p>
        <h3>Volcanic fury</h3>
            <p>
                Old lava flows in India known as the Deccan Traps also seem to match in time with the end of the Cretaceous, <br>
                with massive outpourings of lava spewing forth between 60 and 65 million years ago. <br>
                <br>
                A vast eruption would've choked the sky with carbon dioxide <br>
                and other gases that would have dramatically changed Earth’s climate. <br>
                This event coud've killed most of the animals that lived then. <br>
                <br>
                <br>
            </p>
    <h2>Unlikely Theories</h2>
        <h3>Egg eating</h3>
            <p>
                A Man argued that dinosaurs ate themseleves in their extincion.<br>
                Some dinos had a egg-diet and ate alot of eggs from other dinosaurs,<br>
                but never at a rate that could've caused a mass extincion.
            </p>
        <h3>Dinosaur farts</h3>
            <p>
                A paleontologist and his team tried to calculate how much gas a <br>
                longnecked sauropod produced. Their theory was that the farts <br>
                coud've influenced the global climate. After all, a variaty of sauropods<br>
                existed millions of years without killing themselvs by their farts.
